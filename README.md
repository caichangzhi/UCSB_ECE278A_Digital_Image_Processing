Homework #1: Distance Transform
------------
Consider a binary image - an image consisting of either 0s or 1s. Assume the 1s in the image represent objects and 0s represent the background. The distance transform assigns to each pixel in the image the distance to the closest object pixel. Thus all pixels belonging to the object will have an assigned distance equal to zero. Let us assume that we are interested in computing the distance transform using the manhattan distance.
- Outline an algorithm that would compute such a transform (this should be in the form of a pseudocode or steps that one can easily follow for a computer implementation.) Include this as part of your written sumission, together with 2 example 8x8 patterns input and their corresponding distance transform.
- Implement the above transform in Matlab which can take patterns of arbitrary matrix dimensions and output the corresponding transforms. 
- Include the 2 patterns (as .MAT files) and your computed corresponding outputs.
- Make sure we are able to run the code with the inputs and get the desired output.
